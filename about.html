                <p>I've spent my career working alongside leaders who care deeply about what they are responsible for—and feel the weight that comes with it.</p>
                <p>I partner with senior leaders, boards, and leadership teams as they navigate growth, complexity, transition, and moments where clarity matters more than certainty. My work lives at the intersection of leadership, purpose, and execution.</p>
                <p>I don't come to this work as an outside observer.</p>
                <p>I come to it having carried responsibility myself.</p>
