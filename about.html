            <div class="hero-intro">
                <p>I have spent my career working alongside leaders who care deeply about their mission and feel the weight of real responsibility. Today, I partner with CEOs, senior leaders, boards, and leadership teams as they navigate growth, complexity, and transition, especially when clarity matters more than certainty. My work sits at the intersection of leadership, purpose, and disciplined execution.</p>
                <p>I don't come to this work as an outside observer; I come to it having carried responsibility myself. Before becoming an EOS® Implementer, I spent nearly three decades as a nonprofit C-suite executive, including CEO, leading mission-driven organizations including American Jewish University and JEWISHcolorado. I have been accountable for people, strategy, governance, and outcomes, and I understand what it means to lead when the stakes are real.</p>
                <p>Through The Strear Group, I now help for-profit and nonprofit leadership teams bring clarity, alignment, and traction to their most important goals using the EOS® framework as a practical operating system. The focus is simple strategy, healthy teams, and disciplined execution, so organizations can increase impact without burning out their people. My work is informed by ongoing research with leaders on how structure, process, and accountability support sustainable results over time.</p>
